This project is Library Management System designed to streamline the process of book borrowing and returning while maintaining an accurate inventory of books. The system also keeps track of borrowers, thus ensuring accountability and reducing the likelihood of overdue or lost books.

The software is implemented in Java, making use of object-oriented programming concepts for easy maintenance and updates. It includes classes representing Books, Borrowers, and Transactions, encapsulating all necessary information within these entities. The system supports adding and removing books and borrowers, checking out and returning books, and tracking transactions, i.e., book borrowings.

Moreover, the project incorporates MySQL for persistent data storage, handling the database of books, borrowers, and transactions. This ensures data consistency and durability while allowing for complex queries and reporting.
